              Ophelia got into it because of her resentment against Nico at driving up the rent prices and not being a “real shop owner”. While talking with Matt she discovered that he had it out for Nico for buying a “cheap” painting from him that he found later was actually very expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, after some argument, they go to the store, holding a Marilyn Monroe bust they want to use to break the window and the knife Matt pretended to sell so he could use it without scrutiny. However, they didn’t want to raise Nico’s suspicions immediately; even if they were in disguise, they didn’t want to give him time to react. So Ophelia used her house key to open the door. From there, they sneak in and kill Nico quickly
            </p>
            <p>
              In the kerfuffle, however, the key is lost. They intended to have more time to work through the room and hide the evidence, but now, they have to rush. They tear the place apart, Matt breaks into the safe because Nico kept it there. Ophelia takes the sapphire ring that belonged to Nico’s late wife.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, there was another clue Ophelia wanted to leave behind, to muddy the waters further. She knew from peering at Parker’s shop that Parker always bought black dahlias for his wife. However, buying them for herself would make it suspicious. So she instead talked Emmett into going on a date with Donna, the girl he had a crush on, and lied to him about those being her favorite flowers. She then stole a few petals while she was “helping him set up”

                Good morning, Detective <span class="name" data-name="detective">Starling</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm sorry to disturb you at this time. We all heard about your broken leg down at the precinct, and we hope you get well soon. Unfortunately, as I'm sure you've heard, for the first time in twenty years we've had a murder in Greendale Village. 
              </p>
              <p>
                On Saturday morning <span class="clue" data-clue="diner-owner">a restaurant owner from Lovich Street</span> came barging into the police station. He claims that, on his way to open his diner, he noticed that the <span class="clue" data-clue="bakery-across-diner">bakery across the street</span> still had its lights off and its sign flipped to closed.
                He found this unusual, as its owner, <span class="clue" data-clue="bakery-owner">Nico Galanis</span>, is almost always the first to open shop. Upon crossing the street to check up on Mr. Galanis, the witness found door to the shop was open, and the front window broken. While his speech deteriorated into gibberish from this point forward, it was clear he found the place trashed. Display cases shattered, chairs and tables overturned, emptied cash register, the works. He also saw blood near the back room, where, upon further investigation, we found Mr. Galanis's body.
              </p>
              <p>
                If it's not too much trouble, we could very much use your help. That big-city expertise of yours will be vital towards bringing this killer to justice! If you can't go out yourself, maybe send out some assistants of yours? I'd very much like to work with lovely Ms. Patterson again.
              </p>
              <p>
                Again, hope you feel better,<br>

                I'm so sorry to hear that your shop is running out of space! But, sadly, <span class="clue" data-clue="no-space">I don't think I can give up any space in my shop</span> for you.
